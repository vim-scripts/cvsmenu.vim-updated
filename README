Supports most cvs commands and adds some extended functions. It also works with CVSNT quite well and has some support for multiple encodings. Part of the top-level menus are as follows (screen shot: http://wyw.dcweb.cn/download.asp?path=vim&file=vim_session.png):

- Info
- Setting (switches and update)
- Keyword
- Directory (directory operations; screen shot: http://wyw.dcweb.cn/download.asp?path=vim&file=cvs_localstatus.png)
- Extra (operations on a specific revision, etc.)
- Diff (in the split-window style of Vim; screen shot: http://wyw.dcweb.cn/download.asp?path=vim&file=cvs_diff.png)
- Annotate (screen shot: http://wyw.dcweb.cn/download.asp?path=vim&file=cvs_annotate.png)
- History
- Log (screen shot: http://wyw.dcweb.cn/download.asp?path=vim&file=cvs_log.png)
- Status
- Local status (offline: displays status and version info)
- Check out
- Query update (like WinCVS/gCVS)
- Update (conflicts will be highlighted)
- Add
- Commit

The output can be sorted and is often clickable: it is easy to open conflicting files, etc. It works on single files as well as on whole directories, when called from fileexplorer. It also includes highlighting / mappings to navigate through cvs output or show conflicts.

The menu is displayed in GUI versions of Vim. However, it is useful even in text-only Vim. --- You may choose to use `wildmenu', or you can use key sequences similar to the hot keys in menu. E.g. `alt-c, i' is used to commit with the GUI menu; so `,ci' could be used in text-mode Vim to commit. The leader key, currently `,', can be easily modified in the script.

This is the re-release of Mr Thorsten Maerz's original script (vimscript #58), which was last updated in 2002. It now includes many bug fixes and enhancements. The latest revision of the cvsmenu script can also be found in the SourceForge CVS:

:pserver:anonymous@ezytools.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/ezytools/VimTools/cvsmenu.vim

CvsMenu is able to update itself using this anonymous CVS. Find the menu items under `CVS > Settings > Install'.
